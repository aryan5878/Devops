Task 1:
#include <iostream>

// Environment Sensor class
class EnvironmentSensor {
private:
    int season;
    float temperature;

public:
    EnvironmentSensor(int season, float temperature) {
        this->season = season;
        this->temperature = temperature;
    }

    // Getter methods
    int getSeason() {
        return season;
    }

    float getTemperature() {
        return temperature;
    }
};

// Water Heater class
class WaterHeater {
private:
    float currentTemperature;

public:
    // Setter method
    void setTemperature(float temperature) {
        currentTemperature = temperature;
    }

    // Getter method
    float getTemperature() {
        return currentTemperature;
    }
};

// Smart Geyser class
class SmartGeyser {
private:
    EnvironmentSensor sensor;
    WaterHeater heater;

public:
    SmartGeyser(EnvironmentSensor sensor) : sensor(sensor) {}

    void activateGeyser() {
        float currentTemperature = sensor.getTemperature();
        // Your logic to calculate required temperature based on season and current temperature
        float requiredTemperature = currentTemperature + 10; // Example logic
        heater.setTemperature(requiredTemperature);
    }

    // Getter method
    float getHeatingTemperature() {
        return heater.getTemperature();
    }
};

// Home Owner class
class HomeOwner {
public:
    void getOutOfBed(SmartGeyser& geyser) {
        geyser.activateGeyser();
    }
};

int main() {
    EnvironmentSensor sensor(1, 20.5); // Example values for season and temperature
    SmartGeyser geyser(sensor);
    HomeOwner owner;

    owner.getOutOfBed(geyser);
    std::cout << "Heating temperature: " << geyser.getHeatingTemperature() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Task 2:
Direct interaction between classes: In an ideal scenario, the classes should interact through well-defined interfaces or methods rather than directly calling each other's functions.
Lack of error handling: The sequence diagram does not account for error handling or exceptions.
Incomplete logic: The sequence diagram lacks detailed logic for calculating the required temperature based on season and current temperature.
To address these flaws, you could introduce a more modular and error-resilient approach by adding intermediary methods or classes to handle interactions and errors more effectively.

For example, you could create a separate class or method responsible for calculating the required temperature based on inputs from the environment sensor.

After updating the sequence flow and implementing the changes in the code, you can push the updated version to your GitHub repository with the appropriateÂ comment.
